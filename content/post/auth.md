Developers often refer to the family of ideas surrounding authentication and authorization as, simply, "auth"&mdash; and fair enough, as the two words seem similarly rooted, at least, if not interchangeable. However, their etymologies are not so identical, and the differences can explain which ideas the two concepts do and do not share.

**Authentication** defers its etymology to "authentic", which comes from the Greek word, *authentes*, meaning {{< footref 1 "\"the perpetrator of an act\"" >}}.  So authentication can be thought of as answering the question, "who perpetrated this act?" or simply, "who did this?".  More specifically, authentication refers to {{< footref 2 "\"the act of confirming the truth of an attribute of a single piece of data claimed true by an entity\"" >}}.

**Authorization** hails from the same root as "author": the Latin word, *auctor*, meaning {{< footref 3 "\"author or originator\"" >}}.  Whereas authentication is concerned with confirming identity claims of some actor, authorization is concerned with granting privileges to an actor.  The difference between the two lies in the subtle distinction between determining who someone is and what they should be allowed to do.

> Whereas authentication is concerned with confirming identity claims of some actor, authorization is concerned with granting privileges to an actor.

Each topic is worthy of the entire fields of study dedicated to them, but unpacking the fundamentals of each should clear up any remaining confusion.

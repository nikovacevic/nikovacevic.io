I'm Niko Kovacevic, a software developer living in Boulder, Colorado. This blog, *Today I Learned*, is a product of curiosity---the output of my drive to bring concepts into focus.

As of November 2018, some of my primary interests include [functional programming](/tags/functional-programming), [number theory](/tags/number-theory), and [security](/tags/security). I like to work with [Go](/tags/go) and [Scala](/tags/scala), but the technologies I use professionally ranges from Javascript to Java, to MySQL to Spark.

*Today I Learned* is a product of curiosity by Niko Kovacevic, a software developer living in Boulder, Colorado. The goal is to bring interesting, challenging, or misunderstood concepts into sharper focus.

As of November 2018, some of my primary interests include [functional programming](/tags/functional-programming), [number theory](/tags/number-theory), and [security](/tags/security). I like to work with [Go](/tags/go) and [Scala](/tags/scala), but the technologies I use professionally range from Javascript and Python, to Java and Scala, to MySQL to Spark.
